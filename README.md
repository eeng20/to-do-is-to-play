# to-do-is-to-play README
3296 Software Design Project Proposal - Estelee Eng

Program built on macOS Big Sur 11.7.10 with Visual Studio Code 1.74.3. To run and compile, download all files and run the html file locally by right clicking "to-do is to play.html" and opening it with your browser.
Design with HTML and CSS and built with Javascript, the to-do list can be added to with additional tasks, tasks can be removed on the right with the x button that turns red when it's hovered over. Currently, as you hover over any of the items, at the bottom of the list, it displays the same amount of gems possible to earn for each item hovered over. This will be fixed in the future as this is just proof of concept. Progress bar helps the user visualize how many tasks they have finished, this is currently static and will be fixed in the future.
